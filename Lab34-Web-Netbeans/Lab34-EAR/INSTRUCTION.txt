1. 	There are three projects altogether:
	a)	Lab34-EAR - the container project for ejb and web modules. Contains sun-resources.xml file 
		configuring the JDBC connection pool and JDBC data source. There is NO need to create them manually
		using Glassfish administration console. Please make sure there is neither jdbc/db JDBC resource 
		nor db_pool JDBC Connection Pool created manually on the server.
	b)	Lab34-EAR-ejb - EJB module, here you put your session beans (stateless, with LOCAL user interface)
		and your entity classes. There is NO need to specify entity classes manually in persistence.xml.
	c)	Lab34-EAR-web - web client module, here you put your servlets, JSP pages and tag handler(s). Do NOT run this
		project explicitly. It already includes web.xml and lib.tld files in the WEB-INF folder so there is NO
		need for creating them once again (although at some point you will have to edit them). The welcome page 
		is assumed to be index.jsp, but you have to create it on your own.

2.  The project assumes that db database with db_user, db_pass credentials is available, as in the previous project.

3.  Follow the package naming convention proposed in the previous report, which means you should include your 
	last name and first name in the package name.
